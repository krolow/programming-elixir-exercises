## Functions


The operator ```rem(a, b)``` returns the remainder after dividing ```a``` by ```b```. Write a function that takes a single integer ```(n)``` calls the function in the previous exercise, passing it ```rem(n,3)```, ```rem(n,5)```, and n. Call it 7 times with the arguments 10, 11, 12, etc. You should get “Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz”, 16”.
